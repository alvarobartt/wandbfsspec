# üç± `fsspec` interface for Weights & Biases (wandb)

Quoting Weights and Biases (wandb), "Weights & Biases is the 
machine learning platform for developers to build better models 
faster. Use W&B's lightweight, interoperable tools to quickly track 
experiments, version and iterate on datasets, evaluate model performance, 
reproduce models, visualize results and spot regressions, and share 
findings with colleagues.". Reference at https://docs.wandb.ai/

So you may be thinking, what does `wandb` have to do with anything
close to a File System? Well, it's not but it actually provides a way
to upload/download files and store them in a remote, which makes it somehow
a File System. Also, `wandb` provides an API that lets you interact with
that "File System", so this is why `wandbfsspec` makes sense, in order to ease
that interface between `wandb`'s File System and anyone willing to use it.

Besides the W&B File System, also an Artifact Store is provided, so that
`wandbfsspec` supports both "file-systems", as for the Artifact Store also an
API is provided so as to easily interact with the artifacts uploaded to W&B.

The `wandbfsspec` implementation is based on https://github.com/fsspec/filesystem_spec.

## üö∏ Usage

Here's an example on how to locate and open a file from the File System:

```python
>>> from wandbfsspec.spec import WandbFileSystem
>>> fs = WandbFileSystem(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
>>> fs.ls("alvarobartt/wandbfsspec-tests/3s6km7mp")
['alvarobartt/wandbfsspec-tests/3s6km7mp/config.yaml', 'alvarobartt/wandbfsspec-tests/3s6km7mp/file.yaml', 'alvarobartt/wandbfsspec-tests/3s6km7mp/files', 'alvarobartt/wandbfsspec-tests/3s6km7mp/output.log', 'alvarobartt/wandbfsspec-tests/3s6km7mp/requirements.txt', 'alvarobartt/wandbfsspec-tests/3s6km7mp/wandb-metadata.json', 'alvarobartt/wandbfsspec-tests/3s6km7mp/wandb-summary.json']
>>> with fs.open("alvarobartt/wandbfsspec-tests/3s6km7mp/file.yaml", "rb") as f:
...     print(f.read())
b'some: data\nfor: testing'
```

Which is similar to how to locate and open a file from the Artifact Storage (just changing the class and the path):

```python
>>> from wandbfsspec.spec import WandbArtifactStore
>>> fs = WandbArtifactStore(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
>>> fs.ls("wandb/yolo-chess/model/run_1dnrszzr_model/v8")
['wandb/yolo-chess/model/run_1dnrszzr_model/v8/last.pt']
>>> with fs.open("wandb/yolo-chess/model/run_1dnrszzr_model/v8/last.pt", "rb") as f:
...     print(f.read())
```

üìå Note that it can also be done through `fsspec` as long as `wandbfsspec` is installed:

```python
>>> import fsspec
>>> fs = fsspec.filesystem("wandbfs") # OR fs = fsspec.filesystem("wandbas")
>>> fs.ls("alvarobartt/wandbfsspec-tests/3s6km7mp")
['alvarobartt/wandbfsspec-tests/3s6km7mp/config.yaml', 'alvarobartt/wandbfsspec-tests/3s6km7mp/file.yaml', 'alvarobartt/wandbfsspec-tests/3s6km7mp/files', 'alvarobartt/wandbfsspec-tests/3s6km7mp/output.log', 'alvarobartt/wandbfsspec-tests/3s6km7mp/requirements.txt', 'alvarobartt/wandbfsspec-tests/3s6km7mp/wandb-metadata.json', 'alvarobartt/wandbfsspec-tests/3s6km7mp/wandb-summary.json']
>>> with fs.open("alvarobartt/wandbfsspec-tests/3s6km7mp/file.yaml", "rb") as f:
...     print(f.read())
b'some: data\nfor: testing'
```

## üß™ How to test it

In order to test it, you should first set the following environment variables
so as to use `wandb` as a file system for the tests.

```
WANDB_ENTITY = ""
WANDB_PROJECT = ""
WANDB_API_KEY = ""
```

Both entity and project values can be found in your https://wandb.ai/ account, as
the entity name is your account name, and the project name can either be already
created or you can just specify it and it'll be created during `pytest` init. Then,
regarding the API Key, you just need to go to https://wandb.ai/settings, scroll
down to Danger Zone -> API Keys, and copy your personal API Key from there.

‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure that you don't publish your API Key anywhere, that's why we're defining
it as an environment value, so as to avoid potential issues on commiting code with
the actual API Key value.

Then, in order to actually run the tests you can either run:

- `poetry run pytest`
- `poetry run make tests`

Or, if you're not using `poetry`, you can just run both those commands without it.
